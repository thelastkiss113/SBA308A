## Assignment Requirements
1. Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API.
Use the data provided by this API to populate your applicationâ€™s content and features.

2. Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery,
or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.

3. Enable user manipulation of data within the API through the use of POST, PUT,
or PATCH requests. Ensure your chosen API supports this feature before beginning.
   
4. Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate.

5.Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and
import functions and data across files as necessary.

6. Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by
misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being
handled out of order, etc.).

7. Create an engaging user experience through HTML and CSS.

8. Ensure that the program runs without errors.

9. Commit frequently to the git repository.
